[Unit]
Description=Pi-hole FTLDNS
; This unit is supposed to indicate when network functionality is available, but it is only
; very weakly defined what that is supposed to mean, with one exception: at shutdown, a unit
; that is ordered after network.target will be stopped before the network
After=network.target
Requires=network.target
; A target that should be used as synchronization point for all host/network name service lookups.
; All services for which the availability of full host/network name resolution is essential should
; be ordered after this target, but not pull it in.
Wants=nss-lookup.target
Before=nss-lookup.target
